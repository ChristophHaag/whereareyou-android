Why?
===

* Many, many apps on the play store already.
* closest one to what I imagine: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fourpg.nomad
* all use some sort of 3rd party website, require registration, use sms, send links to google maps, or use social networks
* More of a p2p approach, always try to make direct connections over the internet if possible (Maybe hole punching)
* Try to make it as private as possible

===
Principle
===

* Ability to ask every contact in contact list "where are you"
  * Support as many channels as possible: through google account, sms, email, social media, telephone number (consider not copying and upsetting whatsapp and forgeability)
  * send and receive IPs, try direct connection first (mobile devices might be behind a provider NAT), remember each other's IP and send new IP in case it changes (mobile internet -> wifi)
  * Fallback server for when no direct connection is possible
* If Contact doesn't have the app, ask whether contact should receive link to website that has some of the functionality (low priority)
* Optionally set up pgp keys for encrypting every request and every location update (or use different encryption that works with no prior setup, i.e. diffie hellman key exchange/rsa)

===
Functionality of the app
===

* User can request location of one or more contacts
* Contact receives notification that User wants to access their location once or continuously
* Contact can
  * discard the request at all
  * send feedback to have seen the request but chosen to ignore it
  * deny the request
  * accept the request and send one location update
  * accept the request and send continuous location updates (Contact should have freedom to choose, regardless of what User specified)
* Contact should be able to make the same request synchronously
* Contact's smartphone sends location update once or continuously with a configurable frequency (simple slider)
* Contact can abort continuous update at any point
* User can
  * view only current location of the last update
  * view a trail of when (if so) the Contact started sharing continuously for easier estimating the path
  * temporarily disable viewing the location of any Contact

===
Keep in mind
===

* Some kind of service that doesn't drain the battery
* Push messages should still be received in a matter of seconds
* Show notification icon while sharing the location and while receiving location updates
* Authentication scheme to make sure requests are not forged. (PGP keys should be sufficient, but maybe look at OTR authentication)
* allow users to set up their own fallback server, allow alternative client implementations
  * documented json protocol
  * xmpp (google talk, but not so that it clutters the chat, perhaps try to set up xmpp resource and only use the specific resource for communication)
